Apache Beam: Portability in the times of Real Time Streaming
Apache Beam was open sourced by the big data team at Google in 2016, and has become an active community with participants from all over. Beam is a framework to define data processing workflows and run them on various runners (Flink included). In this talk, I will talk about some cool things you can do with Beam + Flink such as running pipelines written in Go and Python; then I’ll mention some cool tools in the Beam ecosystem. Finally, we’ll wrap up with some cool things we expect to be able to do soon - and how you can get involved.

Apache Beam于2016年由谷歌的大数据团队开放源代码，并已成为一个活跃社区。Beam是一个用于定义数据工作流，并运行在不同的runners（包括Flink）的框架。在本文中，我将讨论一些可以用 Beam+Flink 做的很酷的事情，比如运行用Go和Python编写的管道；然后我将介绍Beam生态系统中的一些很酷的工具。最后，我们将总结一些我们希望很快就能完成的酷的事情——以及如何参与进来。
